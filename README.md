# KyoriAdventureDSL

[🖱️ Docs](https://github.com/EventHorizonLab/KyoriAdventureDSL/tree/master/docs)

KyoriAdventureDSL is a Kotlin‑focused domain‑specific language designed to provide a fluent, expressive, and type‑safe way of building rich [Kyori Adventure](https://github.com/KyoriPowered/adventure) components.

This project aims to:
- Streamline the creation of complex Adventure component trees with a more ergonomic syntax
- Improve readability and maintainability of text formatting code in Kotlin
- Offer an extensible foundation so plugin developers can introduce their own themes, styles, and behaviors
- Integrate cleanly into existing Adventure‑powered projects without boilerplate

> **Status:** Early development — DSL surface, syntax, and extension points are still evolving.  
> **Examples:** Not yet provided; this README will expand as stable features land.
